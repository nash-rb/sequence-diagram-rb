# SequenceDiagram

The intent of this gem is to create UML Sequence Diagrams for documenting a path through a Ruby program. 

Initially this will be accomplished by outputting markdown that can be turned into a diagram. Eventually it will be able to generate the diagrams themselves.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sequence_diagram'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sequence_diagram

## Usage

See the tests for examples of how to use SequenceDiagram.
